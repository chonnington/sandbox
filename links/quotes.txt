“the spirit, in knowing, has no use for number, for numbers are of use only within time, in this defective world. No one can strike his roots into eternity without being rid [of the concept] of number. The human spirit must go beyond all number-ideas, must break past and away from ideas of quantity and then he will be broken into by God…. God leads the human spirit into the desert, into his own unity…. Here the spirit achieves unity and freedom.”

“The purpose of human life is not to avoid mistakes, nor to show an unblemished escutcheon, but to rise to meet the challenges as our destiny reveals itself and to search out in freedom the challenges we wish to engage.”

“When a person has “hit bottom”—i.e., when he has reached ultimate despair—he then can surrender to eternal forces; this is the dynamic in all authentic conversions. I would describe this process as giving up the delusion of false hopes and, thus, acknowledging fully the facts of destiny. Then and only then can this person begin to rebuild himself.”

“Out of such abysses, from such severe sickness one returns newborn, having shed one’s skin, more ticklish and malicious, with a more delicate taste for joy, with a more tender tongue for all good things, with merrier senses, with a second dangerous innocence in joy, more childhood and yet a hundred times subtler than one has ever seen before.”

“for the devil finds employment for the idle”

Excerpt From: Henry David Thoreau. “Walden and on the Duty of Civil Disobedience.” Apple Books.      

“As long as possible live free and uncommitted. It makes but little difference whether you are committed to a farm or the county jail.”


“The really diligent student in one of the crowded hives of Cambridge College is as solitary as a dervisdh in the desert. The farmer can work alone in the field or the woods all day, hoeing or chopping, and not feel lonesome, because he is employed; but when he comes home at night he cannot sit down in a room alone, at the mercy of his thoughts, but must be where he can “see the folks,” and recreate, and as he thinks remunerate, himself for his day’s solitude; and hence he wonders how the student can sit alone in the house all night and most of the day without ennui and “the blues""

Excerpt From: Henry David Thoreau. “Walden and on the Duty of Civil Disobedience.” Apple Books. 

“I find it wholesome to be alone the greater part of the time. To be in company, even with the best, is soon wearisome and dissipating. I love to be alone. I never found the companion that was so companionable as solitude. We are for the most part more lonely when we go abroad among men than when we stay in our chambers. A man thinking or working is always alone, let him be where he will. Solitude is not measured by the miles of space that intervene between a man and his fellows.”

Excerpt From: Henry David Thoreau. “Walden and on the Duty of Civil Disobedience.” Apple Books. 

“So, I really believe that genuine change is possible,” he concluded, “but, of course, change takes time. As we mentioned, these attitudes are based on false beliefs and distortions of thinking, and any change in society must first begin in the individual mind and heart, with a transformation of that person’s outlook. This change occurs one person at a time.”

Excerpt From: Dalai Lama. “The Art of Happiness in a Troubled World.” Apple Books. 

“If a man has faith he will cooperate with equal faith every where; if he has not faith, he will continue to live like the rest of the world, whatever company he is joined to. To cooperate, in the highest as well as the lowest sense, means to get our living together. I heard it proposed lately that two young men should travel together over the world, the one without money, earning his means as he went, before the mast and behind the plough, the other carrying a bill of exchange in his pocket. It was easy to see that they could not long be companions or cooperate, since one would not operate at all. They would part at the first interesting crisis in their adventures. Above all, as I have implied, the man who goes alone can start to-day; but he who travels with another must wait till that other is ready, and it may be a long time before they get off.”

Excerpt From: Henry David Thoreau. “Walden and on the Duty of Civil Disobedience.” Apple Books. 

“There are a thousand hacking at the branches of evil to one who is striking at the root, and it may be that he who bestows the largest amount of time and money on the needy is doing the most by his mode of life to produce that misery which he strives in vain to relieve. It is the pious slave-breeder devoting the proceeds of every tenth slave to buy a Sunday’s liberty for the rest. Some show their kindness to the poor by employing them in their kitchens. Would they not be kinder if they employed themselves there? You boast of spending a tenth part of your income in charity; may be you should spend the nine tenths so, and done with it. Society recovers only a tenth part of the property then. Is this owing to the generosity of him in whose possession it is found, or to the remissness of the officers of justice?”

“Every morning was a cheerful invitation to make my life of equal simplicity, and I may say innocence, with Nature herself.”

Excerpt From: Henry David Thoreau. “Walden and on the Duty of Civil Disobedience.” Apple Books. 

“Books are the treasured wealth of the world and the fit inheritance of generations and nations. Books, the oldest and the best, stand naturally and rightfully on the shelves of every cottage. They have no cause of their own to plead, but while they enlighten and sustain the reader his common sense will not refuse them. Their authors are a natural and irresistible aristocracy in every society, and, more than kings or emperors, exert an influence on mankind. When the illiterate and perhaps scornful trader has earned by enterprise and industry his coveted leisure and independence, and is admitted to the circles of wealth and fashion, he turns inevitably at last to those still higher but yet inaccessible circles of intellect and genius, and is sensible only of the imperfection of his culture and the vanity and insufficiency of all his riches, and further proves his good sense by the pains which he takes to secure for his children that intellectual culture whose want he so keenly feels; and thus it is that he becomes the founder of a family.”

“I had this advantage, at least, in my mode of life, over those who were obliged to look abroad for amusement, to society and the theatre, that my life itself was become my amusement and never ceased to be novel. It was a drama of many scenes and without an end. If we were always indeed getting our living, and regulating our lives according to the last and best mode we had learned, we should never be troubled with ennui. Follow your genius closely enough, and it will not fail to show you a fresh prospect every hour.”

“The characteristic distortions of thinking caused by anger are well documented, and can serve as a good example of the more specific narrowing and distorting effects of negative emotions. Extensive research has confirmed the Dalai Lama’s observations that when angry people think about a situation or person, or when they seek to solve a problem, they tend to oversimplify facts, think very quickly and superficially, and come to quick judgments. Their thinking is thus narrowed, or limited, by filtering out details and avoiding deeper investigation or analysis.”

Excerpt From: Dalai Lama. “The Art of Happiness in a Troubled World.” Apple Books. 

“I think the very first place to start when learning to cope with such situations is with your basic outlook, recognizing that life will never be completely trouble-free, never totally danger-free. That you must accept.”

Excerpt From: Dalai Lama. “The Art of Happiness in a Troubled World.” Apple Books. 

“That will reduce fear. In fact, you will often find cases where there might be two individuals in the very same dangerous situation, yet one of them copes much more effectively than the other—here it’s one’s outlook that could make the difference. In fact, an individual’s response to a dangerous situation and ability to deal with fear can often depend more on the person’s outlook and personal characteristics than on the nature of the situation itself.”

“With a subtle smile on his face, a smile confined mostly to his eyes, I think maybe because he was pleased at my enthusiasm to stick with this topic, he agreed to my request, saying, “OK. To review, then, this training of the mind involves cultivating positive states of mind and overcoming the negative states of mind, the destructive emotions, or what are known as the afflictive emotions. As we have discussed in the past, according to Buddhist theory, the positive mental states are those which lead to greater happiness. The negative or destructive emotions cause disturbances within our mind, destroying our mental happiness. These afflictive emotions lead to greater suffering. From the Buddhist point of view, we consider these positive mental qualities to be antidotes to the destructive or afflictive mental states—as you strengthen the positive emotion, there will be a corresponding reduction in the influence and force of the negative emotion. So, within Buddhist practice there are certain positive mental factors that act as specific antidotes to their corresponding negative or afflictive emotions—for example, patience or tolerance acts as an antidote to anger, compassion or loving-kindness as an antidote to hatred, and factors such[…]”

“One morning two men were driving to a very important business meeting, and they were running really late. On the way to the meeting they got a flat tire. Needless to say, the passenger got really upset about this, but he noticed that the driver remained completely calm and undisturbed by the situation, and immediately just set about changing the tire. As they were changing the tire, the passenger became more and more agitated each minute, but the driver just kept working, still totally unflustered. So finally the passenger couldn’t help but ask, “We’re going to be so late, how can you be so calm about this?” And almost cheerfully, the driver answered, “This is number three!” Unsatisfied of course, the passenger asked him to explain, and he said, “Many years ago, when I first started to drive, I read a statistic giving the average number of flat tires that motorists will have during their driving years. So, right then I just decided to expect my fair share of flat tires, which by the way still has not reached the average, and at the same time I realized that no matter when or where I got my blow-outs[…]”

“As Shantideva points out in his Guide to the Bodhisattva’s Way of Life, before you embark on a venture, first examine it properly to see whether or not you can do it. You shouldn’t plunge into it hastily. I think that just the clear awareness that your objective is really possible to achieve can help strengthen your hope and determination.”

Excerpt From: Dalai Lama. “The Art of Happiness in a Troubled World.” Apple Books. 

“The method begins by cultivating a deep sense of our common humanity, a profound awareness of the common characteristics we share with every other human being. This becomes the basis for generating a sense of empathy for every human being. This empathy becomes the basis for generating compassion. Generating a feeling of compassion will lead directly to greater personal happiness. Acting on the basis of that compassion will result in taking steps to overcome the problems of today’s world, and will eventually lead to “a happier society, as well as a more peaceful world.”

“In one of my favorite experiments on the link between personal happiness and compassion, Dr. Davidson and his colleagues brought a French-Tibetan Buddhist monk into his lab to study the effects of compassion. This monk was a highly trained adept, who had spent many years in the Himalayan region, meditating on compassion. Hooking him up to his EEG and fMRI machines, Davidson began by monitoring the monk’s brain function in a resting state to measure baseline brain activity, then he asked him to perform an intensive Buddhist meditation on compassion. The results showed that during his meditation on compassion, there was a dramatic leftward shift in his prefrontal function, lighting up the “happiness region” of the brain, leading Davidson to conclude: “The very act of concern for others’ well-being creates a greater sense of well-being within oneself.” What could be more conclusive evidence of the link between personal happiness and compassion?”

To accept battle at a time when it is obviously advantageous to the enemy and not to us is a crime

- LENIN

By the same token, the failure to engage in the conflict when the relation of forces is favorable is equally a crime. The choice of Soviet tactics is, therefore, at each time and place determined by their assessment of the “objective correlation of forces,” which as Marxists they pride themselves on discerning.

“we are more likely to find, as we do time and again in psychoanalysis, that a crisis is exactly what is required to shock people out of unaware dependence upon external dogma and to force them to unravel layers of pretense to reveal naked truth about themselves which, however unpleasant, will at least be solid.”

“When I consider the brief span of my life, swallowed up in the eternity before and behind it, the small space that I fill, or even see, engulfed in the infinite immensity of spaces which I know not, and which know not me, I am afraid, and wonder to see myself here rather than there; for there is no reason why I should be here rather than there, now rather than then.”

Rarely has the existential problem been put more simply or beautifully. In this passage we see, first, the profound realization of the contingency of human life which existentialists call “thrownness.”

In responding to the anxiety of fate and guilt, for ex-
ample, Tillich invokes what he calls "the courage of confidence." Genuine belief is maintained "in spite of" circumstances that would undermine belief and not simply because of circumstances that would confirm i t It does not take a great deal of imagination or courage
to believe that God is on your side when you are pros- pering or winning; it takes a great deal of courage and imagination to believe that God is on your side when you are suffering or losing. To believe in love in the face of hatred, life in the face of death, day in the dark
of night, good in the face of evil—to some, all of these may seem to be hopelessly naive, wishful thinking, "whistling in the dark" (a decidedly non-Tillichian phrase); but, to Tillich, all of these are manifestations
of enormous courage, the courage of confidence in more than the sovereignty of fact and appearance.

-- Tillich Intro

Now, however, we look to the future. I had a little quote in the speech last night from T.R. [Theodore Roosevelt]. As you know, I kind of like to read books. I am not educated, but I do read books -- and the T.R. quote was a pretty good one. Here is another one I found as I was reading, my last night in the White House, and this quote is about a young man. He was a young lawyer in New York. He had married a beautiful girl, and they had a lovely daughter, and then suddenly she died, and this is what he wrote. This was in his diary.

He said, "She was beautiful in face and form and lovelier still in spirit. As a flower she grew and as a fair young flower she died. Her life had been always in the sunshine. There had never come to her a single great sorrow. None ever knew her who did not love and revere her for her bright and sunny temper and her saintly unselfishness. Fair, pure and joyous as a maiden, loving, tender and happy as a young wife. When she had just become a mother, when her life seemed to be just begun and when the years seemed so bright before her, then by a strange and terrible fate death came to her. And when my heart's dearest died, the light went from my life forever."

That was T.R. in his twenties. He thought the light had gone from his life forever -- but he went on. And he not only became President but, as an ex-President, he served his country, always in the arena, tempestuous, strong, sometimes wrong, sometimes right, but he was a man.

And as I leave, let me say, that is an example I think all of us should remember. We think sometimes when things happen that don't go the right way; we think that when you don't pass the bar exam the first time -- I happened to, but I was just lucky; I mean, my writing was so poor the bar examiner said, "We have just got to let the guy through." We think that when someone dear to us dies, we think that when we lose an election, we think that when we suffer a defeat that all is ended. We think, as T.R. said, that the light had left his life forever. Not true.

It is only a beginning, always. The young must know it; the old must know it. It must always sustain us, because the greatness comes not when things go always good for you, but the greatness comes and you are really tested, when you take some knocks, some disappointments, when sadness comes, because only if you have been in the deepest valley can you ever know how magnificent it is to be on the highest mountain.

“And if the civilized man’s pursuits are no worthier than the savage’s, if he is employed the greater part of his life in obtaining gross necessaries and comforts merely, why should he have a better dwelling than the former?”

"If there is," says Seneca, "no other attribute which belongs to man as man except reason, then reason will be his one good, worth all the rest put together."

"What conflicts with the courage of wisdom is desires and fears. The Stoics developed a profound doctrine of anxiety which also reminds us of recent analyses. They discovered that the object of fear is fear itself."

-- Courage and Wisdom: The Stoics


Life, willing to surpass itself, is the good life, and the good life is the courageous life. It is the life of the "power- ful soul" and the "triumphant body" whose self-enjoy- ment is virtue. Such a soul banishes "everything cowardly; it says: bad—that is cowardly" (III, 54).

The will which commands it- self is the creative will. It makes a whole out of fragments and riddles of life. It does not look back, it stands beyond a bad conscience, it rejects the "spirit of revenge" which is the innermost nature of self-accusation and of the con- sciousness of guilt, it transcends reconciliation, for it is the will to power (II, 42). In doing all this the courageous self is united with life itself and its secret (II, 34).


We may conclude our discussion of Nietzsche's ontol- ogy of courage with the following quotation: "Have ye courage, O my brethren? . . . Not the courage before witnesses, but anchorite and eagle courage, which not even a God any longer beholdeth? . . . He hath heart who knoweth fear but vanquisheth it; who seeth the abyss, but with pride. He who seeth the abyss but with eagle's eyes,—he who with eagle's talons graspeth the abyss: he hath courage" (IV, 73, sec. 4).

-- Courage and Life:  Nietzsche

“What is the meaning of “power” in the development of this concept? The phrase “will to power” means self-actualization. Nietzsche was protesting against the weak, anemic, European man he saw emerging on all sides. The “will to power” is a call to man to avoid the putrescense and to affirm himself in his existence with strength and commitment. The “will to power” is built into every individual because it is inseparable from life itself. “Wherever I found life,” writes Nietzsche, “there I found the will to power.”

Excerpt From: May, Rollo. “The Discovery of Being: Writings in Existential Psychology.” Apple Books. 

“Kaufmann succinctly summarizes Nietzsche’s belief at this point:
Man’s task is simple: he should cease letting his “existence” be “a thoughtless accident.” Not only the use of the word Existent, but the thought which is at stake, suggests that [this essay] is particularly close to what is today called Existenz-philosophie. Man’s fundamental problem is to achieve true “existence” instead of letting his life be no more than just another accident. In The Gay Science Nietzsche hits on a formulation which brings out the essential paradox of any distinction between self and true self: “What does your conscience say?—You shall become who you are.” Nietzsche maintains this conception until the end, and the full title of his last work is Ecce Homo, Wie man wird, was man ist—how one becomes what one is.13”

Excerpt From: May, Rollo. “The Discovery of Being: Writings in Existential Psychology.” Apple Books. 

“In an infinite variety of ways, Nietzsche holds that this power, this expansion, growing, bringing one’s inner potentialities into birth in action is the central dynamic and need of life. His work here relates directly to the problem in psychology of what the fundamental drive of organisms is, the blocking of which leads to neurosis: it is not urge for pleasure or reduction of libidinal tension or equilibrium or adaptation. The fundamental drive rather is to live out one’s potentia. “Not for pleasure does man strive,” holds Nietzsche, “but for power.”14 Indeed, happiness is not absence of pain but “the most alive feeling of power,”15 and joy is a “plus-feeling of power.”16 Health, also, he sees as a by-product of the use of power, power here specifically described as the ability to overcome disease and suffering.17”

Excerpt From: May, Rollo. “The Discovery of Being: Writings in Existential Psychology.” Apple Books. 

“Nietzsche writes, “bad conscience is nothing other than the instinct of freedom forced to become latent, driven underground, and forced to vent its energy upon itself.”

Excerpt From: May, Rollo. “The Discovery of Being: Writings in Existential Psychology.” Apple Books. 

“Generally speaking, modern man is in this condition; if ontological demands worry him at all, it is only dully, as an obscure impulse.”2 Marcel points out what many students have emphasized, that this loss of the sense of being is related on one hand to our tendency to subordinate existence to function: a man knows himself not as a man or self but as a token seller in the subway, a grocer, a professor, a vice-president of AT&T, or by whatever his economic function may be. And on the other hand, this loss of the sense of being is related to the mass collectivist trends and widespread conformist tendencies in our culture. Marcel then makes this trenchant challenge: “Indeed I wonder if a psychoanalytic method, deeper and more discerning than any that has been evolved until now, would not reveal the morbid effects of the repression of this sense and of the ignoring of this need.”

Excerpt From: May, Rollo. “The Discovery of Being: Writings in Existential Psychology.” Apple Books. 

“For if your self-esteem must rest in the long run on social validation, you have not self-esteem but a more sophisticated form of social conformity. It cannot be said too strongly that the sense of one’s own existence, though interwoven with all kinds of social relatedness, is in basis not the product of social forces; it always presupposes Eigenwelt, the “own world”

Excerpt From: May, Rollo. “The Discovery of Being: Writings in Existential Psychology.” Apple Books. 

“Nor do we need to go as far as the extreme example of death to discover the problem of nonbeing. Perhaps the most ubiquitous and ever-present form of the failure to confront nonbeing in our day is in conformism, the tendency of the individual to let himself be absorbed in the sea of collective responses and attitudes, to become swallowed up in das Mann, with the corresponding loss of his own awareness, potentialities, and whatever characterizes him as a unique and original being. The individual temporarily escapes the anxiety of nonbeing by this means, but at the price of forfeiting his own powers and sense of existence.”

Excerpt From: May, Rollo. “The Discovery of Being: Writings in Existential Psychology.” Apple Books. 

“Severe anxiety, hostility, and aggression are states and ways of relating to oneself and others which would curtail or destroy being. But to preserve one’s existence by running away from situations which would produce anxiety or situations of potential hostility and aggression leaves one with the vapid, weak, unreal sense of being—what Nietzsche meant in his brilliant description of the “impotent people” who evade their aggression by repressing it and thereupon experience “drugged tranquillity” and free-floating resentment.”

“The self-affirmation of a being is the stronger the more nonbeing it can take into itself.”

Excerpt From: May, Rollo. “The Discovery of Being: Writings in Existential Psychology.” Apple Books. 

“We have stated that the condition of the individual when confronted with the issue of fulfilling his potentialities is anxiety. We now move on to state that when the person denies these potentialities, fails to fulfill them, his condition is guilt That is to say, guilt is also an ontological characteristic of human existence.7”

Excerpt From: May, Rollo. “The Discovery of Being: Writings in Existential Psychology.” Apple Books. 

“We have cited only one form of ontological guilt—namely, that arising from forfeiting one’s own potentialities. There are other forms as well. Another, for example, is ontological guilt against one’s fellows, arising from the fact that since each of us is an individual, each necessarily perceives his fellow man through his own limited and biased eyes. This means that he always to some extent does violence to the true picture of his fellow man and always to some extent fails fully to understand and meet the other’s needs. This is not a question of moral failure or slackness—though it can indeed be greatly increased by lack of moral sensitivity. It is an inescapable result of the fact that each of us is a separate individuality and has no choice but to look at the world through his own eyes. This guilt, rooted in our existential structure, is one of the most potent sources of a sound humility and an unsentimental attitude of forgiveness toward one’s fellow men.
”

Excerpt From: May, Rollo. “The Discovery of Being: Writings in Existential Psychology.” Apple Books. 

"The difference between the neurotic and the healthy (although potentially neurotic) personality is the follow- ing: the neurotic personality, on the basis of his greater sensitivity to nonbeing and consequently of his pro- founder anxiety, has settled down to a fixed, though lim- ited and unrealistic, self-affirmation. This is, so to speak,
the castle to which he has retired and which he defends with all means of psychological resistance against attack, be it from the side of reality or from the side of the ana- lyst. And this resistance is not without some instinctive wisdom. The neurotic is aware of the danger of a situa-
tion in which his unrealistic self-affirmation is broken down and no realistic self-affirmation takes its place. The danger is either that he will fall back into another and much better defended neurosis or that with the breakdown
of his limited self-affirmation he will fall into an unlimited
despair"

Excerpt from the Courage To Be - Paul Tillich

“World is the structure of meaningful relationships in which a person exists and in the design of which he participates. Thus world includes the past events which condition my existence and all the vast variety of deterministic influences which operate upon me. But it is these as I relate to them, am aware of them, carry them with me, molding, inevitably forming, building them in every minute of relating. For to be aware of one’s world means at the same time to be designing it.”
