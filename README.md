The contents contained herein do not accurately represent my knowledge and capabilities in the respective languages in which examples are laid out.

This repo is solely to explore concepts and theories; in addition to centralizing any learnings, takeaways, and code modules.

Suffice it to say, for one to judge my capabilities by perusing this repo is akin to subscribing to the proverb: "Judging a book by its cover"

In this day and age, surely one's Git repo is one's best ability to convey capabilities; however, that being acknowledged, I will happily forego such naive approach in validating what I know I can do and deliver.
