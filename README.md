The contents contained herein do not accurately - nor does it comprehensively - represent my knowledge and capabilities in the respective languages in which examples are laid out.

For what it's worth, any abstractions gathered from the exercise of observation to the contents contained herein can be a loose proxy to guage my programmatic capabilities.

This repo is solely to explore concepts and theories; in addition to centralizing any learnings, takeaways, and code modules.

Suffice it to say, for one to judge my capabilities by perusing this repo is akin to subscribing to the proverb: "Judging a book by its cover"
