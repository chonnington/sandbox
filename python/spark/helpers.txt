The two most common transformations you will likely be using are map() and fil ter() (see Figure 3-2). The map() transformation takes in a function and applies it to each element in the RDD with the result of the function being the new value of each element in the resulting RDD. The filter() transformation takes in a function and returns an RDD that only has elements that pass the filter() function.
